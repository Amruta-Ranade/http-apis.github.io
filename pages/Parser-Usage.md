# Open Api -> Hydra Parser 


Open Api Specification(OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic . Hydra and Open Api can be considered as siblings working forward to achieve the same goal. OAS is quite extensive and has gained a lot of popularity in the recent times . To allow the users of Open Api to experiment with and to use Hydrus in their projects it is very important to provide an easy way of migration . Both Hydrus and Open Api require that the user defines the structure of the API`s via a document known as API documentation . In the current scenario if an existing Open Api user wants to experiment with Hydrus he/she would have to write the Api Documentation again for Hydrus . As this becomes a huge barrier for entry eliminating this barrier makes sense.

## Use Cases 

### Convert OAS to Hydra 
Just pass the Open Api Documentation to the `parse` method of the parser to get the api documentation which can be used by hydrus to setup the server.

For example 

```
from openapi_parser import parse
hydrus_api_documentation = parse(open_api_documentation)
```
 
### Object Definition to Hydra Class 
Object definition given under any key in OAS can be converted to Hydra Class . Information like object name , properties are given in the definition , this can be used to construct a Hydra Class using functions given in `doc_writer.py`.

      username:

      firstName:
        type:                     string
      email:
        type:                     string
    xml:
      name:                       User
```

        },
```

### Open Api paths to Hydra Suported operations

Endpoint are defined in the OAS under the key `paths` , each endpoint has operations allowed at that endpoint defined under it. The parser parses these methods and adds them to corresponding classes. The classes are already defined and stored in dictionary `classAndClassDefinition` , the methods are simply added to the definition and the dictionary is updated again. The class to which these methods have to be added is found by looking under the keys `parameters` or `responses` , here we will find a reference to an object definition defined in the document itself or an external definition . The class is the object that is referred in the method .
