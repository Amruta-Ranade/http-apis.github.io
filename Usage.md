## The APIDocumentation
Much of Hydrus is built around the Hydra API Documentation. The API Doc is defined in the Hydra spec [here](http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/).
The API Doc is the entity that tells Hydrus how the server must be set up, what are the endpoints that must be created, what data needs to be served, the operations supported by the data and so on.
Hydrus uses Python classes in `hydrus.hydraspec.doc_writer` to create/define API Docs. A description of these classes and their design can be found in the [Design](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/wiki/Design) section.

<!-- ![doc_writer](https://image.ibb.co/eWURkQ/doc_writer.png) -->

The `hydurs.hydraspec.doc_writer.HydraDoc` object is crucial for Hydrus to be able to set up the API. There are a number of ways you can create this object from your API Documentation:

<a name="newdoc"></a>
### Create a new API Documentation and a new `HydraDoc` object
The `doc_writer` can be used to create an API Doc itself as defined below:

The first step is to create a new `HydraDoc` object
```python
# Sample to create Hydra APIDocumentation using doc_writer

from hydrus.hydraspec.doc_writer import HydraDoc

API_NAME = "demoapi"
BASE_URL = "https://hydrus.com/"
ENTRY_POINT = "api"
# API_NAME is the name of the api
# The API will be accessible at BASE_URL + ENTRY_POINT (http://hydrus.com/api/)

api_doc = HydraDoc(API_NAME,
                   "Title for the API Documentation",
                   "Description for the API Documentation",
                   ENTRY_POINT,
                   BASE_URL)
```

The API Documentation is created, but it is not yet complete, we still need to add classes, properties and operations to the Doc. We also need to generate the EntryPoint object which is crucial for the API and it's operations to be discovered by a Hydra Client.

We will now define a class for this API Documentation, which is of the type `HydraClass`
```python
from hydrus.hydraspec.doc_writer import HydraClass

# Creating classes for the API
class_uri = "http://hydrus.com/dummyClass"  # URI of class for the HydraClass
class_title = "dummyClass"  # Title of the Class
class_description = "A dummyClass for demo"     # Description of the class
class_ = HydraClass(class_uri, class_title, class_description, endpoint=False)
# Setting endpoint=True creates an endpoint for the class itself, this is usually for classes that have single instances
# These classes should not ideally have a Collection, although Hydrus allows creation of such Collections
```
Classes need to have properties that allow them to store information related to the class, much like attributes in a Python class, these are stored as `supportedProperty` of the `HydraClass`.
```python

from hydrus.hydraspec.doc_writer import HydraClassProp

# Create new properties for the class
prop1_uri = "http://hydrus.com/prop1"   # The URI of the class of the property
prop1_title = "Prop1"   # Title of the property
dummyProp1 = HydraClassProp(prop1_uri, prop1_title , required=False, read=False, write=True)

prop2_uri = "http://hydrus.com/prop2"
prop2_title = "Prop2"
dummyProp2 = HydraClassProp(prop1_uri, prop2_title, required=False, read=False, write=True)

# Properties that are required=True must be added during class object creation
# Properties that are read=True are read only
# Properties that are write=True are writable
```
Apart from properties, classes also need to have operations that allow them to modify the data stored within their instances, these operation are defined as `HydraClassOp` and are stored in `supportedOperation` of the `HydraClass`.

```python
from hydrus.hydraspec.doc_writer import HydraClassOp

# Create operations for the class
op_name = "SubmitProp"  # The name of the operation
op_method = "POST"  # The method of the Operation [GET, POST, PUT, DELETE]
op_expects = "vocab:Drone"  # URI of the object that is expected for the operation
op_returns = None   # URI of the object that is returned by the operation
op_status = [{"statusCode": 200, "description": "Drone updated"}]   # List of statusCode for the operation

op1 = HydraClassOp(op_name
                   op_method,
                   op_expects,
                   op_returns,
                   op_status)
```

Once the classes and properties have been defined, we need to add them to the class.

```python
# Add the operation and properties to the Class
class_.add_supported_prop(prop1)
class_.add_supported_prop(prop2)

class_.add_supported_op(op1)
```
Now that we have defined a class along with it's properties and operations, we must add this class to the APIDocumentation.

```python
# Add the class to the HydraDoc
api_doc.add_supported_class(class_, collection=True)

# NOTE: Using collection=True creates a HydraCollection for the class.
#       The name of the Collection is class_.title+"Collection"
#       The collection inherently supports GET and PUT operations
```

Apart from basic these, an API Documentation also needs to have the Resource and Collection classes, so that Collections and their members can be identified by the server. This can be done automatically using the `add_baseResource` and `add_baseCollection` methods.

```python
# Other operations
api_doc.add_baseResource()  # Creates the base Resource Class and adds it to the API Documentation
api_doc.add_baseCollection()    # Creates the base Collection Class and adds it to the API Documentation
```
Finally we need to create the EntryPoint object for the API Documentation. All Collections are automatically assigned endpoints in the EntryPoint object. Classes that had their `endpoint` variables set to `True` are also assigned endpoints in the EntryPoint object, this object is created automatically by the `HydraDoc` object, and can be created using the `gen_EntryPoint` method.
```python
api_doc.gen_EntryPoint()    # Generates the EntryPoint object for the Doc using the Classes and Collections
```
The final API Documentation can be viewed by calling the `generate` method which returns a Python dictionary containing the entire API Documentation.
```python
doc = api_doc.generate()  # Returns the entire API Documentation as a Python dict
```

In case you already have an API Doc defined in JSON or a Python dict, Hydrus provides a way to turn this API Doc into `doc_writer` classes. This is done using `hydrus.hydraspec.doc_maker` as defined below:
```python
# Sample to convert the API Doc into doc_writer classes

from hydrus.hydraspec.doc_maker import createDoc

# Note: It would be better to use json.loads from the python json library to create 'doc'
doc = {
  "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
  "@id": "http://api.example.com/doc/",
  "@type": "ApiDocumentation",
  "title": "The name of the API",
  "description": "A short description of the API",
  "entrypoint": "URL of the API's main entry point",
  "supportedClass": [
    # ... Classes known to be supported by the Web API ...
  ],
  "possibleStatus": [
    # ... Statuses that should be expected and handled properly ...
  ]
}

APIDoc = createDoc(doc, HYDRUS_SERVER_URL="https://hydrus.com", API_NAME="demoapi")
# HYDRUS_SERVER_URL and API_NAME are optional parameters. If not defined, the default values from the doc object are used.
```

## Setting up the database
The databse models use SQLAlchemy as an ORM Layer mapping relations to Python Classs and Objects. A good reference for the ORM can be found [here](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/orm/tutorial.html)

The `engine` parameter in `hydrus.data.db_models` is used to connect to the database. This needs to be modified according to the type of connection:
For example, if the database is an SQLite database, the engine parameter would be as follows:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

hydrus.data.db_models.engine = create_engine('sqlite:///path/to/database/file')
```
Once the engine is setup, the creation of the required tables can be done as follows:

```python
from hydrus.data.db_models import Base

Base.metadata.create_all(hydrus.data.db_models.engine)
```
This will successfully create all required models in the specified database.

<a name="adddata"></a>
## Adding data
Now that the database models have been setup, we need to populate them with data.

<a name="classprop"></a>
### Adding Classes and Properties
The first step in adding data is adding the RDFClasses and Properties that the server must support. There are three ways to do this:

The first is to manually add all RDFClasses and Properties. Here are some examples:
```python
'''Adding a new RDFClass'''
from hydrus.data.db_models import RDFClass, engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

thermal = RDFClass(name="Subsystem_Thermal")    # Creates a new RDFClass instance

# Add the instance to the database
Session = sessionmaker(bind=models.engine)
session = Session()
session.add(thermal)
session.commit()
session.close()
```
```python
'''Adding a new Property'''
from hydrus.data.db_models import AbstractProperty, InstanceProperty, engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

subclassof = AbstractProperty(name="SubClassOf")    # Creates a new AbstractProperty instance
cost = InstanceProperty(name="hasMonetaryValue")    # Creates a new InstanceProperty instance

# Add the instance to the database
Session = sessionmaker(bind=models.engine)
session = Session()
session.add(subclassof)
session.add(cost)
session.commit()
session.close()
```
The second way to add RDFClasses and Properties is to provide the Hydra APIDocumentation of the API
```python
import hydrus

data = {
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
    "@id": "http://api.example.com/doc/",
    "@type": "ApiDocumentation",
    "title": "The name of the API",
    "description": "A short description of the API",
    "entrypoint": "URL of the API's main entry point",
    "supportedClass": [
        # ... Classes known to be supported by the Web API ...
        {
            "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
            "@id": "http://api.example.com/doc/#Comment",
            "@type": "Class",
            "title": "The name of the class",
            "description": "A short description of the class.",
            "supportedProperty": [
            # ... Properties known to be supported by the class ...
            ]
        },
    ],
    "possibleStatus": [
        # ... Statuses that should be expected and handled properly ...
    ]
}

classes = hydrus.data.doc_parse.get_classes(data)
properties = hydrus.data.doc_parse.get_all_properties(classes)
hydrus.data.doc_parse.insert_classes(classes)
hydrus.data.doc_parse.insert_properties(classes)
```

The final way to add classes and properties to Hydrus is to use RDF/OWL vocabulary. This can be done by using the OWL/RDF parser to generate a list of Hydra classes which is then used by `hydrus.hydraspec.vocab_generator` to generate the ApiDocumentation and then adding data from the ApiDocumentation as explained in the previous step.
```python
from hydrus.hydraspec import parser

data = {
    {
       "@type": [
          {
              "@id": "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#ObjectProperty"
          }
       ],
       "@id": "http://api.example.com/doc/#Property",
       "rdf:label": "Propertyname"
    },
    {
       "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Class",
       "@id": "http://api.example.com/doc/#Class",
       "rdf:comment": "comment about the class",
       "rdf:label": "Classname",
       "rdfs:subClassOf": [
            # ...List of known class restrictions...
       ],
    }
}

    # Get all the owl:ObjectProperty objects from the vocab
    owl_props = get_all_properties(data)

    # Convert each owl:ObjectProperty into a Hydra:SupportedProperty, also get classes that support it based on domain and range.
    hydra_props = hydrafy_properties(owl_props, SEMANTIC_REF_NAME)

    # Get all the owl:Class objects from the vocab
    owl_classes = get_all_classes(subsystem_data)

    # Convert each owl:Class into a Hydra:Class, also get supportedProperty for each
    hydra_classes = hydrafy_classes(
        owl_classes, hydra_props, SEMANTIC_REF_NAME)

    # Create API Documentation with the Hydra:Class list
    supported_classes = gen_supported_classes(hydra_classes)
```
---
### Adding Instances/Resources
To add objects to the instances for a given class, we first need to define a standard way of declaring instances.
We have given an example of a subsystem instance below
```python
instance = {
    "name": "12W communication",    # The name of the instance must be in "name"
    "object": {
        # The "object" key contains all the properties and their values for a given instance
        "maxWorkingTemperature": 63,    # InstanceProperty: Value, Value is automatically converted to Terminal Object

        # In case the Value for a property is another Resource, we use the following syntax
        "hasDuplicate":{
            "@id": "subsystem/34"   # The "@id" tag gives the ID of the other instance
        }

        # In case the property is an AbstractProperty, the class name should be given as Value
        "@type": "Spacecraft_Communication",     # AbstractProperty: Classname, Classname is automatically mapped to relevant RDFClass
    }
}

```
Once we have defined such an `instance`, we can use the built-in CRUD operations of Hydrus to add these instances.
```python
from hydrus.data import crud

crud.insert(object_=instance)   # This will insert 'instance' into Instance and all other information into Graph.

# Optionally, we can specify the ID of an instance if it is not already used
crud.insert(object_=instance, id_=1)    #This will insert 'instance' with ID = 1  
```

<a name="setup"></a>
## Setting up a Hydra server from OWL vocabulary
Setting up a new Hydra server from Hydrus is pretty straightforward and involves the following steps:
### 1. The first step is parsing the `HydraClasses` and their `SupportedProperties` from the OWL vocabulary.
To setup a new Hydra server you need to provide an OWL vocabulary.

`Hydrus.hydraspec.parser` can be used to generate parsed classes. Just import the OWL vocabulary in `parser.py` and run it. It will parse and convert all the OWL classes and properties into `HydraClasses` and their `SupportedProperties`.

For example -
We have the `Subsystem` OWL vocabulary defined in `Hydrus.metadata.subsystem_vocab_jsonld`.

Import this into `parser.py` using
```python
from hydrus.metadata.subsystem_vocab_jsonld import subsystem_data
```
Pass this vocab to data
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # NOTE: Usage must be in the following order
        # get_all_properties() >> hydrafy_properties() >> properties
        # get_all_classes() + properties >> hydrafy_classes() >> classes
        # classes >> gen_APIDoc()

    data = subsystem_data
    # Get all the owl:ObjectProperty objects from the vocab
    owl_props = get_all_properties(data)
    ......
```
Running the `parser.py` will return `HydraClasses` and their `SupportedProperties`.<br/>
We can save this as `parsed_classes` using Output redirection. Running `python parser.py > parsed_classes` should do it!<br/>
Now we're ready to move forward. The next steps involve generating a Hydra vocabulary and various contexts.

### 2. Generating `HydraVocab` from parsed classes
`Hydrus.hydraspec.vocab_generator` can be used to generate a Hydra Vocabulary from the parsed classes. Vocab generator mainly consists `gen_vocab` function.
```python
def gen_vocab(parsed_classes, server_url, semantic_ref_name, semantic_ref_url):
    """Generate Hydra Vocabulary."""
    SERVER_URL = server_url
    SEMANTIC_REF_NAME = semantic_ref_name
    SEMANTIC_REF_URL = semantic_ref_url

    vocab_template = {
        "@context": {
            "vocab": SERVER_URL + "api/vocab#",
            "hydra": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#",
            semantic_ref_name: semantic_ref_url,
            "ApiDocumentation": "hydra:ApiDocumentation",
            "property": {
                "@id": "hydra:property",
                "@type": "@id"
},
......
```
We need to pass the following variables into `gen_vocab()` for generation of a Hydra Vocabulary
* `parsed_classes` - Use the classes parsed earlier from the OWL vocabulary.
* `server_url` - Url where the server is hosted.
* `semantic_ref_name` - Semantic reference name is the name to be given to the semantic reference Url ( Remote Semantic Vocabulary). For example, in this case we are using `subsystems` as semantic reference name.
* `sematic_ref_url` - Semantic reference Url for the item types.

Vocab generator uses a Hydra Vocabulary template `vocab_template` to generate the required hydra vocabulary.

After passing all these variables, simply running the `vocab_generator.py` will return a Hydra vocabulary for the server.<br/>

```python
 # DEMO
    pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
    pp.pprint(gen_vocab(parsed_classes, SERVER_URL, "subsystems",
"http://ontology.projectchronos.eu/subsystems"))
```
Use Output redirection to save it, Running `python vocab_generator.py > vocab` should do it!

### 3. Generating the `Entrypoint` and `Entrypoint_context`
* #### Entrypoint Generator
`Hydrus.hydraspec.entrypoint_generator` uses an Entrypoint template to generate the required Entrypoint data.
```python
def gen_entrypoint(server_url):
    """Generate EntryPoint."""
    SERVER_URL = server_url

    entrypoint_template = {
      "@context": "/api/contexts/EntryPoint.jsonld",
      "@id": "/api",
      "@type": "EntryPoint",
    }

    supported_ops = gen_supported_ops(parsed_classes)
    for op in supported_ops:
        entrypoint_template[op.keys()[0]] = op[op.keys()[0]]

    return entrypoint_template
```
We can generate the data for entrypoint simply by doing something like this:
```python
pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
pp.pprint(gen_entrypoint(`server_url`))
```
* #### Entrypoint Context Generator
`Hydrus.hydraspec.entrypoint_context_generator` also uses a similar template to generate the entrypoint context.
```python

def gen_entrypoint_context(server_url):
    """Generate context for the EntryPoint."""
    SERVER_URL = server_url

    entrypoint_context_template = {
        "@context": {
            "hydra": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#",
            "vocab": SERVER_URL + "api/vocab#",
            "EntryPoint": "vocab:EntryPoint",
            ##Supported Operations will be appended here
        }
    }
    supported_ops = gen_supported_ops(parsed_classes)
    for op in supported_ops:
        entrypoint_context_template["@context"][op.keys()[0]] = op[op.keys()[0]]
    return entrypoint_context_template

```
We can generate the data for entrypoint context simply by doing something like this:
```python
pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
pp.pprint(gen_entrypoint_context(SERVER_URL))
```

Both the `Hydrus.hydraspec.entrypoint_generator` and `Hydrus.hydraspec.entrypoint_context_generator` can be used to generate `Entrypoint` and `Entrypoint_context` data.

### 4. Binding all the generated data in `Hydrus.app`
`Hydrus.app` is the main `Flask` application from where all the Contexts and endpoints are server.<br/>
The implementation of `app.py` is pretty straightforward.

Modify `Hydrus.app` to use the generated data (`vocab`, `entrypoint` and `entrypoint_context`) and change the endpoints depending upon your requirements.<br/>
Endpoints are defined in `api.add_resource` like this:

```python
# Needs to be changed manually
api.add_resource(Item, "/api/<string:type_>/<int:id_>", endpoint="item")

```

### 5. Starting the API server
Use [these](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/wiki#demo) instruction to start your hydra development server locally.<br>
**NOTE**: You'll have to modify the OWL vocabulary references in these instructions too.


<a name="moddata"></a>
## Manipulating data
We already saw how `insert` work in the Adding instance section, we will now see how the other crud operations work and what are the errors and exceptions for each of them.

<a name="crud"></a>
### CRUD opertions
Apart from `insert`, the CRUD operations also support `get`, `delete` and `update` opertions. Here are examples for all three:

GET
```python
from hydrus.data import crud
import json

instance = crud.get(id_=1, type_="Spacecraft_Communication")     # Return the Resource/Instance with ID = 1
print(json.dumps(instance, indent=4))
# Output:
# {
#     "name": "12W communication",
#     "object": {
#         "@type": "Spacecraft_Communication",
#         "hasMass": 98,
#         "hasMonetaryValue": 6604,
#         "hasPower": -61,
#         "hasVolume": 99,
#         "maxWorkingTemperature": 63,
#         "minWorkingTemperature": -26
#     }
# }
```
DELETE
```python
from hydrus.data import crud
import json

output = crud.delete(id_=1, type_="Spacecraft_Communication")     # Deletes the Resource/Instance with ID = 1
print(json.dumps(output, indent=4))
# Output:
# {
#   204: "Object with ID : 1 successfully deleted!"
# }
```
UPDATE
```python
from hydrus.data import crud
import json

new_object = {
    "name": "14W communication",
    "object": {
        "@type": "Spacecraft_Thermal",
        "hasMass": 8,
        "hasMonetaryValue": 6204,
        "hasPower": -10,
        "hasVolume": 200,
        "maxWorkingTemperature": 63,
        "minWorkingTemperature": -26
    }
}
output = crud.update(id_=1, object_=new_object)     # Updates the Resource/Instance with ID = 1 with new_object
print(json.dumps(output, indent=4))
# Output:
# {
#   204: "Object with ID : 1 successfully updated!"
# }
```
---
<a name="error"></a>
### Exceptions
The CRUD operations have a number of checks and conditions in place to ensure validity of data. Here are the exceptions that are returned for each of the operations when these conditions are violated.
NOTE: Relevant all responses are returned in JSON format

GET
```python

# A 401 error is returned when a given AbstractProperty: Classname pair has an invalid/undefined RDFClass
{   
    401: "The class dummyClass is not a valid/defined RDFClass"
}

# A 404 error is returned when an Instance is not found
{
    404: "Instance with ID : 2 NOT FOUND"
}

```

INSERT
```python
# A 400 error is returned when an instance with a given ID already exists
{
    400: "Instance with ID : 1 already exists"
}

# A 401 error is returned when a given AbstractProperty: Classname pair has an invalid/undefined RDFClass
{   
    401: "The class dummyClass is not a valid/defined RDFClass"
}

# A 402 error is returned when a given Property: Value pair has an invalid/undefined Property
{
    402: "The property dummyProp is not a valid/defined Property"
}

# A 403 error is returned when a given InstanceProperty: Instance pair has an invalid/undefined Instance ID
{   
    403: "The instance 2 is not a valid Instance"
}
```

DELETE
```python

# A 401 error is returned when a given AbstractProperty: Classname pair has an invalid/undefined RDFClass
{   
    401: "The class dummyClass is not a valid/defined RDFClass"
}

# A 404 error is returned when an Instance is not found
{
    404: "Instance with ID : 2 NOT FOUND"
}
```

The `update` operation is a combination of a `delete` and an `insert` operation. All exceptions for both the operation are inherited by update.

### Setting up the server
The following section explains how the server needs to be setup to be able to serve the data we added in the previous section.

The generic server is implemented using the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) micro-framework. To get the server up and running, all you need to do is:
```python
from hydrus.app import app

IP = "127.0.0.1"
port_ = 8000
app.run(host=IP, port=port_)

# The server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

<a name="test"></a>
## Running tests
There are a number of tests in place to ensure that Hydrus functions properly.
For running tests related to ensuring the validity of the database run

**`python -m unittest hydrus.data.test_db`**

For running client side tests related to the server, run

**`python -m unittest hydrus.test_app`**

<a name="useclient"></a>
## Using the client
(Under developement) client not yet ready
