# Open Api -> Hydra Parser 


Open Api Specification(OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic . Hydra and Open Api can be considered as siblings working forward to achieve the same goal. OAS is quite extensive and has gained a lot of popularity in the recent times . To allow the users of Open Api to experiment with and to use Hydrus in their projects it is very important to provide an easy way of migration . Both Hydrus and Open Api require that the user defines the structure of the API`s via a document known as API documentation . In the current scenario if an existing Open Api user wants to experiment with Hydrus he/she would have to write the Api Documentation again for Hydrus . As this becomes a huge barrier for entry eliminating this barrier makes sense.
