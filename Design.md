# Design

This page explains the design, architecture and the implementation of hydrus along with a few use cases for the same.

## REST to Hydra to hydrus
To understand how hydrus represents REST resources and how the developer is helped to work with Hydra, it is possible to
 start from thinking at Hydra as generic framework that describes REST API resources to make data exchanges automated.

Instances (objects) belonging to a Resource are named `Item`s in hydrus. It is possible to perform HTTP operations over
 `Item`s. At a lower layer the REST Resource is of a kind of an `hydra:Resource`, all the objects of the same kind are members
 of an `hydra:Collection`. As Hydra inherits from RDF, thanks to the framework it is possible to represent the API as a RDF graph.
 hydrus allows the developer to take advantage of this powerful description by abstracting away the complexity of RDF and
 to work on the REST layer. This multi-layered architecture allows REST APIs to work with automated clients and leverage
 new powerful ways of querying the data.

### Database Design
The design of the Database takes into account the different types of representations possible using the triple format.
Typically, there are 4 types of triples that are stored in a `Graph`:
* **`Class >> Property >> Class` [`GraphCAC`]**
* **`Resource >> Property >> Class` [`GraphIAC`]**
* **`Resource >> Property >> Resource` [`GraphIII`]**
* **`Resource >> Property >> Value` [`GraphIIT`]**

For a distinction between the different types of `Value`, we created a `Terminal` class, which contains a `value` and it's `unit`.
There is also a distinction between properties that map to `Resources` and `Terminals` and those that map to `Classes`.
We call `Properties` that map to `Classes` as `AbstractProperty` and the other as `InstanceProperty`.

Below is the schema diagram for our database design:

### Data Flow
Here is a small illustration as to how data flows in hydrus.

Hydra API Documentation to server endpoints:

![API Flow](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/blob/develop/docs/wiki/images/hydra_dataflow.png?raw=true "API Flow")

RDF/OWL declarations to server endpoints:

### Use cases
This section explains hydrus's design and a use case for the same.
For the demonstration, the server has the [Subsystems](http://ontology.projectchronos.eu/documentation/subsystems) and [Spacecraft](http://ontology.projectchronos.eu/documentation/spacecraft) vocabularies.

Here is an example of a system used to serve data using the components of hydrus:

![Use case](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/blob/develop/docs/wiki/images/use_case1.png?raw=true "Use case")

**A simple example explaining the use of the above architecture would be:**
* User types in the query “What is the cost of a Thermal Subsystem?”.
* Middleware uses NLP to extract keywords `Thermal Subsystem` and `cost` and maps it to the Hydra instances and properties present at the server.
* Middleware passes these instances and the underlying query to the client.
* Client models a request and uses the API endpoints to extract the given information from the server.
* Server replies with the required value.
* Client serves data to the User.

### Adding Instances/Resources
To add objects to the instances for a given class, we first need to define a standard way of declaring instances.
We have given an example of a subsystem instance below
```python
instance = {
    "name": "12W communication",    # The name of the instance must be in "name"
    "object": {
        # The "object" key contains all the properties and their values for a given instance
        "maxWorkingTemperature": 63,    # InstanceProperty: Value, Value is automatically converted to Terminal Object

        # In case the Value for a property is another Resource, we use the following syntax
        "hasDuplicate":{
            "@id": "subsystem/34"   # The "@id" tag gives the ID of the other instance
        }

        # In case the property is an AbstractProperty, the class name should be given as Value
        "@type": "Spacecraft_Communication",     # AbstractProperty: Classname, Classname is automatically mapped to relevant RDFClass
    }
}

```
Once we have defined such an `instance`, we can use the built-in CRUD operations of hydrus to add these instances.
```python
from hydrus.data import crud

crud.insert(object_=instance)   # This will insert 'instance' into Instance and all other information into Graph.

# Optionally, we can specify the ID of an instance if it is not already used
crud.insert(object_=instance, id_=1)    #This will insert 'instance' with ID = 1  
```

## Manipulating data
We already saw how `insert` work in the Adding instance section, we will now see how the other crud operations work and what are the errors and exceptions for each of them.

### CRUD opertions
Apart from `insert`, the CRUD operations also support `get`, `delete` and `update` opertions. Here are examples for all three:

GET
```python
from hydrus.data import crud
import json

instance = crud.get(id_=1, type_="Spacecraft_Communication")     # Return the Resource/Instance with ID = 1
print(json.dumps(instance, indent=4))
# Output:
# {
#     "name": "12W communication",
#     "object": {
#         "@type": "Spacecraft_Communication",
#         "hasMass": 98,
#         "hasMonetaryValue": 6604,
#         "hasPower": -61,
#         "hasVolume": 99,
#         "maxWorkingTemperature": 63,
#         "minWorkingTemperature": -26
#     }
# }
```
DELETE
```python
from hydrus.data import crud
import json

output = crud.delete(id_=1, type_="Spacecraft_Communication")     # Deletes the Resource/Instance with ID = 1
print(json.dumps(output, indent=4))
# Output:
# {
#   204: "Object with ID : 1 successfully deleted!"
# }
```
UPDATE
```python
from hydrus.data import crud
import json

new_object = {
    "name": "14W communication",
    "object": {
        "@type": "Spacecraft_Thermal",
        "hasMass": 8,
        "hasMonetaryValue": 6204,
        "hasPower": -10,
        "hasVolume": 200,
        "maxWorkingTemperature": 63,
        "minWorkingTemperature": -26
    }
}
output = crud.update(id_=1, object_=new_object)     # Updates the Resource/Instance with ID = 1 with new_object
print(json.dumps(output, indent=4))
# Output:
# {
#   204: "Object with ID : 1 successfully updated!"
# }
```

### Exceptions
The CRUD operations have a number of checks and conditions in place to ensure validity of data. Here are the exceptions that are returned for each of the operations when these conditions are violated.
NOTE: Relevant all responses are returned in JSON format

GET
```python

# A 401 error is returned when a given AbstractProperty: Classname pair has an invalid/undefined RDFClass
{   
    401: "The class dummyClass is not a valid/defined RDFClass"
}

# A 404 error is returned when an Instance is not found
{
    404: "Instance with ID : 2 NOT FOUND"
}

```

INSERT
```python
# A 400 error is returned when an instance with a given ID already exists
{
    400: "Instance with ID : 1 already exists"
}

# A 401 error is returned when a given AbstractProperty: Classname pair has an invalid/undefined RDFClass
{   
    401: "The class dummyClass is not a valid/defined RDFClass"
}

# A 402 error is returned when a given Property: Value pair has an invalid/undefined Property
{
    402: "The property dummyProp is not a valid/defined Property"
}

# A 403 error is returned when a given InstanceProperty: Instance pair has an invalid/undefined Instance ID
{   
    403: "The instance 2 is not a valid Instance"
}
```

DELETE
```python

# A 401 error is returned when a given AbstractProperty: Classname pair has an invalid/undefined RDFClass
{   
    401: "The class dummyClass is not a valid/defined RDFClass"
}

# A 404 error is returned when an Instance is not found
{
    404: "Instance with ID : 2 NOT FOUND"
}
```

The `update` operation is a combination of a `delete` and an `insert` operation. All exceptions for both the operation are inherited by update.
